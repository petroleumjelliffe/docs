Purpose
===
Are there any games where you experience natural selection?  You're a replicator, blind, without motives, just a tendency towards more offspring and a longer life.  

You can't see what others are doing, or feel their impact.  You could know whether you're still alive. 


Let a person experience the true randomness of natural selection.  (I'm on a evolutionary psychology kick.)





It would include random mutation. 


You draw a line, any line (your gene advancing through time)


   * Curves are mutations

When you line crosses another, your line gets duplicated from that point at a random distance left or right (offspring)


You don't know if you intersect another line (blind)


Each line has random length before running out (life span) so the only way to stay alive is replicating (crossing other lines)


You start with a dot. As you move it leaves a trail. 

You always go straight, in the direction of your phone. Accelerometer tilts and wobbles make it curve. 

As you progress, your path get additional traits. Colors, thickness, textures, patterns, average length of line.

Traits are dominant or recessive. When crossing another path, half your traits pair with the other dot's path. 

Result is a Monte Carlo simulation (100 different combos of the lines, where the offspring duplicate at different locations. The subsequent lines will be different in each case, but your dot's path is always the same. 

Board is infinite and bound, like pacman or surface of cylinder. Going off one side, you come back on the other. 

When all your dots paths run out,your game is over. You can't tell how many dots you have active. (Only works if you do one path, so would need to run for a while to use in all scenarios. 

Questions
How does exaptation work?  Trait used for one thing gets used for something else. 
How much computation required?
Do angles change after intersecting?  Can't ever go sideways or backwards. So need a limit to how far left or right dot can move each second. 
Is it grid based? Hx tile based?
Turn based or real time?  It's blind, to turn based might work.
