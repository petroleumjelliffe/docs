## Monthly planner

* **Page Size**  8.5x11 isn’t big enough for sketches.  Think bigger than that.  Started out with legal paper which is 3 inches longer, but still narrow.  We have a lot of tabloid paper so started using that for sketching.

* **Grid** Horizontal rule is ok for notes, but not for sketching.  A grid with boxes is fine, but can be very dense.  I discovered a dotted grid paper notebook at Muji a few years ago and fell in love with it.  It hints at the grid, and uses a lot less ink.  Not quite chartjunk, but it’s an economic use of ink and just more elegant.  
The dots are spaced 5 per inch, and I emphasized a larger grid by using darker dots every 5th one.

* **Look ahead** 
Three weeks is better than 1.  That is, I decided to show the following two work weeks below the current one, so I could track milestones and events on the same page.  Not having to flip through pages can be handy, to counteract “out of sight, out of mind”.
At the beginning of the following week, I copy the milestones and left over todos to the new sheet.  Re-writing those items on Monday morning helps remind me of everything that didn’t get done the week before.


* **Booklet** 
Rather than printing a new sheet out every week, I now print out 3 double-sided sheets that contain 5 weeks. And instead of stapling them all together in a corner, and having blank pages on the back side, I print double-sided sheets I can fold into a booklet. The 11x17 tabloid paper folds into a 8.5x11 booklet which fits into most notebooks and binders.   I also added a front and back cover where I can list out goals and milestones to hit during that period on the first page, and then list out completed goals on the back and see how well I did.
